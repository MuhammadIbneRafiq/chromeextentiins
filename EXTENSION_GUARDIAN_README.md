# Extension Guardian Desktop Application

A powerful Windows desktop application that monitors your browser extension status and enforces restrictions when the extension is disabled, similar to Cold Turkey's approach.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time Extension Monitoring**: Continuously monitors browser extension status
- **Automatic Browser Closure**: Closes browsers when extension is disabled
- **Uninstall Protection**: Timer-based protection against application uninstallation
- **Multi-browser Support**: Works with Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox
- **Native Messaging**: Secure communication between extension and desktop app
- **Warning System**: User-friendly notifications and countdown timers
- **Auto-start Option**: Can start automatically with Windows

## üìã Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Administrator privileges (for full functionality)
- Your browser extension already installed

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Step 1: Install Python Dependencies

1. Run `install-guardian.bat` as Administrator
2. This will install required Python packages and create shortcuts

### Step 2: Setup Native Messaging

1. Run `setup-native-messaging.bat` as Administrator
2. This registers the native messaging host with your browsers

### Step 3: Configure Extension ID

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find your extension ID (looks like: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456`)
3. Edit `com.extensionguardian.native_messaging_manifest.json`
4. Replace `your-extension-id-here` with your actual extension ID
5. Restart your browser

## üéØ How It Works

### Extension Monitoring
The desktop application continuously monitors:
- Browser processes (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Firefox)
- Extension status in each browser
- Registry entries for extension state
- Native messaging communication

### When Extension is Disabled
1. **Detection**: App detects extension has been disabled
2. **Warning**: Shows a 5-second warning dialog
3. **Action**: Automatically closes all browser instances
4. **Logging**: Records the event in logs

### Uninstall Protection
- Set a timer (1-168 hours)
- Prevents application uninstallation during the timer
- Registry modifications block uninstall attempts
- Emergency disable option available

## üñ•Ô∏è Using the Application

### Main Interface

**Start/Stop Monitoring**
- Click "Start Monitoring" to begin watching for disabled extensions
- Click "Stop Monitoring" to pause monitoring

**Status Display**
- Shows current monitoring status
- Displays running browser processes
- Shows extension status for each browser

**Quick Actions**
- "Close All Browsers": Manually close all browser instances
- "Open Extension Page": Opens `chrome://extensions/`
- "View Logs": Opens the logs directory

### Settings Tab

**Monitoring Settings**
- Enable/disable monitoring
- Enable/disable automatic browser closure
- Set check interval (5-300 seconds)

**Extension Settings**
- Configure your extension ID
- Select which browsers to monitor

### Protection Tab

**Uninstall Protection**
- Set protection duration (1-168 hours)
- Enable/disable protection
- Emergency disable option

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Uninstall protection prevents you from uninstalling the application for the specified duration. Only enable if you're certain you want this protection.

## üì° Native Messaging

The system uses Chrome's native messaging API for secure communication:

1. **Extension ‚Üí Desktop App**: Heartbeat messages every 30 seconds
2. **Status Updates**: Extension status changes are reported
3. **Auto-start**: Desktop app can be started automatically

### Troubleshooting Native Messaging

If native messaging isn't working:

1. Check that the extension ID is correct in the manifest
2. Verify registry entries were created successfully
3. Restart your browser after setup
4. Check logs for error messages

## üìÅ File Structure

```
extension-guardian/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extension-guardian-desktop.py      # Main desktop application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ native-messaging-host.py           # Native messaging bridge
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ com.extensionguardian.native_messaging_manifest.json  # Chrome manifest
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt                   # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ install-guardian.bat              # Installation script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup-native-messaging.bat        # Native messaging setup
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EXTENSION_GUARDIAN_README.md      # This file
```

## üîß Configuration

Configuration is stored in `%USERPROFILE%\ExtensionGuardian\config.json`:

```json
{
  "extension_id": "your-extension-id-here",
  "monitoring_enabled": true,
  "browser_close_enabled": true,
  "check_interval_seconds": 10,
  "browsers": ["chrome.exe", "msedge.exe", "brave.exe", "firefox.exe"]
}
```

## üìä Logs

Logs are stored in `%USERPROFILE%\ExtensionGuardian\logs\`:
- Daily log files with timestamp
- Extension status changes
- Browser closure events
- Error messages and debugging info

## üö® Security Considerations

### Registry Access
- The application modifies Windows registry for uninstall protection
- Requires administrator privileges for full functionality
- All changes are logged and reversible

### Process Monitoring
- Monitors running browser processes
- Terminates browsers when extension is disabled
- Uses standard Windows APIs

### Native Messaging
- Secure communication channel between extension and desktop app
- Validates extension identity
- Encrypted message passing

## üîÑ Updates and Maintenance

### Updating the Extension
1. Update your browser extension as normal
2. The desktop app will automatically detect the new version
3. No additional configuration needed

### Updating the Desktop App
1. Stop the current application
2. Replace the Python files
3. Run `install-guardian.bat` again if needed
4. Restart the application

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Extension ID not found"**
- Verify your extension ID in settings
- Check that the extension is installed and enabled

**"Native messaging failed"**
- Re-run `setup-native-messaging.bat` as Administrator
- Verify registry entries exist
- Restart your browser

**"Browsers not closing"**
- Check if you have administrator privileges
- Verify browser processes are running
- Check logs for error messages

**"Protection not working"**
- Ensure you're running as Administrator
- Check registry permissions
- Use emergency disable if needed

### Getting Help

1. Check the logs directory for error messages
2. Verify all prerequisites are met
3. Try running as Administrator
4. Check Windows Event Viewer for system errors
